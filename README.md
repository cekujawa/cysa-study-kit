# CySA+ Study Kit

A terminal-based study toolkit I built while preparing for **CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-003)**.  
Includes:
- 📝 Interactive flashcards (`quizzes/questions.yaml`)
- 🔎 PBQ-style scenarios (`pbq/scenarios/`)
- 📊 Daily findings reports (`reports/`)
- 🛠 Python CLI tools (`cli/`) for practice

This repo tracks my progress and serves as a reusable study resource.
